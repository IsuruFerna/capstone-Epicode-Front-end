# Social Media App 🚀

This is a social media app where users can:

- 📝 Register, log in, and post text and image content
- 👥 Add friends and follow other users
- 💬 Chat with follow-back users in real-time

This application uses:

- ⚛️ React for Front-end
- ☕ Spring-boot + Postgresql for the backend
- 🕸️ Websockets for the chat system

The UI is completely designed by the author with Adobe XD. 🎨

There are two separate git repositories for each front-end and backend:

- [🌐 Front-end repo]: https://github.com/IsuruFerna/capstone-Epicode-Front-end
- 🗄️ Back-end repo: `https://github.com/IsuruFerna/Capstone-Epicode-Backend`


## 🌐 Front-end 
### Requirements 📋

To run this project, you need to create a `.env` file in the **root folder** of your front-end project and add the server link of your back-end application. The server link is the URL of your back-end app, which you can get from your hosting service or your local machine. For example, if you are using Heroku, you can find the server link in the settings tab of your app. If you are running the back-end locally, you can use `http://localhost:8080` or whatever port you are using. 🖥️

To create a `.env` file, you can use any text editor and save it as `.env` in your root folder. Then, you can copy the contents of the `env.example` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual server link. For example:

`REACT_APP_BE_URL = "your server link here"`

That's it. Now you can use the `REACT_APP_BE_URL` variable in your front-end code to make requests to your back-end. 🚀


## Getting Started 🚀

To run this project, you need to have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine.

Then, you need to clone the front-end repository to your local folder. You can use the following command in your terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/user/social-media-app-frontend.git`

Next, you need to navigate to the project folder and install the dependencies. You can use the following commands in your terminal:

`cd capstone-Epicode-Front-end`
`npm install`

Finally, you need to start the development server. You can use the following command in your terminal:

`npm start`

This will open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`. 🎉
